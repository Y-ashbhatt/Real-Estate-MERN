## What I've Learned
Throughout this project, I have gained hands-on experience in:

- Firebase Authentication: Implementing Google OAuth using Firebase simplified authentication with OAuth 2.0 standards.
- State Management: Leveraging Redux Toolkit for global state management, especially with complex features like authentication and property listings.
- File Handling: Implementing image uploads and managing file storage on the frontend and backend gave me a deeper understanding of handling multipart/form-data in a RESTful API.
- Advanced Search Features: Learning to build efficient search functionalities by filtering data on the server side with MongoDB and enhancing the user experience on the client side.
- Error Handling: Creating middleware for centralized error handling improved my understanding of writing clean, maintainable code.
- Deployment: Deploying the app on Render helped me better understand the deployment process, including environment configuration, database integration, and optimizing production builds.
